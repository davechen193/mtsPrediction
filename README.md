### Multivariate Time Series Prediction

The module provide a multivariate time series prediction functionalities that include inputs from time series encoded inputs given rolling input window size and rolling output horizon size. The module is further enhanced by providing an exog input layer indicating the state variables besides the time series encoded inputs. An example notebook is provided to show the model predicting sinusoidals with arbitrary composition.
